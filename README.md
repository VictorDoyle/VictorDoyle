# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome To My Github Profile 

Hi, I'm Victor. I'm a Software Engineer who is passionate about building things. I'm known as a jack of all trades with experience in multiple branches of knowledge: Technology, Politics, Sociology, Economics, Literature, Philosophy and many more!

## ðŸ˜Ž About Me 

My life's goal is to promote innovation and to create limitless applications that can truly push the boundaries of our modern conventions. I define myself by the work that I set out to do and the infinite amounts of energy that I have towards reaching that goal. My personality and mental character of wanting to constantly reach for the stars and beyond often reflects in my work and is something that will always be part of me.

I have officially finished the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive and I'm hungry to code as much as possible and build as many applications, websites, packages, apis as I can! Feel free to contact me or get in touch if you're in need of a coding partner.
